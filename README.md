Designed a user interactive Graphical User Interface that visualizes various earthquakes as pointers
on the world map, with each earthquake pointer having a different style representing various attributes of the
earthquake like magnitude, depth, land quake, ocean quake, etc. Additionally, the GUI has many other features
like mouse clicks and mouse hover as shown in the video. [Earthquake GUI Video.mp4](Earthquake%20GUI%20Video.mp4)
